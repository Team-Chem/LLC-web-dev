1.	Software used to run localhost and phpMyAdmin.
•	XAMPP - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
•	This software has built in Apache and phpMyAdmin to run the localhost on your machine and allows the user to easily create and maintain a database.

2.	How to get XAMPP up in running.
•	Go to the link above and download and install XAMPP for your machine.
•	All the files for the project will need to be stored inside the “htdocs” folder within XAMPP so that the pages will render.
•	 
•	This will be the same folder for Windows or MAC
•	 
•	Two additional folders were created “project” and then inside this folder is another folder “capstone”. Within the capstone folder, this is where the app and db folders need to be stored.
•	The “app” folder contains all the PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS files.
•	The “db” folder contains all the files related to the database. This is where the connection was created between pages that have forms and the database.
